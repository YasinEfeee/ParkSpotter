# ParkSpotter

This project aims to make the parking search process faster, more efficient, and accessible with an AI-supported system.  
The system stands out with real-time monitoring in marketplaces, shopping malls, and private parking lots, providing priority access for individuals with disabilities, anomaly detection, and a low-cost technology infrastructure.  
Developed using Python and the YOLOv8 model, the project contributes to environmental sustainability goals while optimizing traffic flow.

## !! Firebase Integration Warning
